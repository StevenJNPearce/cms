Market Protocol provides the inoperability necessary for order routing and other trading activities on the blockchain. It’s an open source protocol that powers decentralized derivative trading and decentralized derivative exchanges. Developers can create decentralized applications – dApps – on top of MARKET Protocol. That means non-technical traders can easily interact with the underlying blockchain technology through the use of these dApps.
