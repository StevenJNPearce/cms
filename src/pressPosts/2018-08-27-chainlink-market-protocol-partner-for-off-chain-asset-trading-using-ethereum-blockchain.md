ChainLinkâ€™s reliable and secure network connections enable MARKET Protocol derivatives traders to create highly complex derivatives smart contracts. MARKET Protocol contracts can now be made using any/all market data, on-chain events, and off-chain events, which will allow them to become a superior alternative to legacy derivatives contracts.
